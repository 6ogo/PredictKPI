Delivery Level Data

File name: delivery_data.csv

- InternalName (Delivery identifier)
- Subject (Email subject line)
- Date (Date and time of delivery)
- Sendouts (Total sendout count for delivery)
- Opens (Total Opens count in delivery)
- Clicks (Total Clicks count in delivery)
- Optouts (Total unsubscribe count in delivery)
- Dialog, Syfte, Produkt (Campaign metadata)

Example:

DM123456;2024/06/10 15:59;14827;2559;211;9;F;VD;Mo;Take the car to your next adventure

Customer Level Data

File name: customer_data.csv
- Primary key (Customer identifier)
- InternalName (Delivery identifier to link with delivery data)
- OptOut (OptOut in delivery 1/0)
- Open (Opened delivery 1/0)
- Click (Clicked in delivery 1/0)
- Gender (Customer gender)
- Age (Customer age)
- Bolag (Customer company connection)

Example:
Primary key;OptOut;Open;Click;Gender;Age;InternalName;Bolag
12345678;0;1;0;Kvinna;69;DM123456;Stockholm

I want to build a streamlit app with these requirements:

-Aggregate the .csv files on internalname
-Calculate the Openrate, Clickrate and Optoutrate from Opens, Clicks and Optouts (They all end with s and come from delivery_data.csv) these are the total number of Opens, Clicks and Optouts for each InternalName
-XGBoost model-fit from files and results in a tab.
 
Fields for users to choose their new sendout parameters:
Dialog, Syfte, Produkt, Agespan (Min 18, Max 100), which bolag to EXCLUDE with checkboxes and their Subjectline - To see the KPI they need to set for the sendout.

Here I want to implement groq API;
Subjectline recommendations and tips, and their calculated openrates - give multiple suggestions and do A/B/C/D testing. A is always the user-input and the B/C/D tests are AI generated tips that "test them" on the users. Subjectlines are only prone to change the openrate. I want to send a good prompt to get the recommendations for the tests and calculations, package the subjetline and its' result, no other information and fetch it in a good way.

Good information for context
-There could be duplicates of PrimaryKeys or InternalName in Customer_data.csv, this is because a primarykey (user) can have recieved multiple sendouts (InternalNames). And a sendout (InternalName) include all the users (PrimaryKeys) that recieved the sendout.
-The CSV files are UTF-8 and semicolon ";" seperated.

Send me the entire code.
